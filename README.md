# Dice-Roller

As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice.It will generate a random number each dice the program runs, and the users can use the dice repeatedly for as long as he wants. When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate a random number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice).
